# xfinity_login
## Update:
This project is currently deprecated, well........becuase Xfinity. But dont worry I'll be back with an update, Internet afterall should be free.
You can currently still DNS tunnel and gain free internet, but will hit some limitations far as bandwith is concerned. 

## About:
Xfinity has over 18 million hotspots worldwide. If you don't already know you can get a free hour of high speed internet if you are in range by signing up to be a new customer. However the only thing that Xfinity will validate for when signing up new users is a unused email and new Mac Address.
This program is running on a headless pi to stay online in several locations. 
So far the program takes about 30 seconds to run. 
## Get Started:
<code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

<code> Python 3.7.4 (default, Sep  7 2019, 18:27:02)</code>
