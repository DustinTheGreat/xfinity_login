Xfinity has over 18 million hotspots worldwide. If you don't already know you can get a free hour of high speed internet if you are in range by sighning up to be a new customer. However the only thing that Xfinity will validate for when signing up new users is a unused email and new mac address. It didn't take long for the process to become tedious so I decided to automate it.
I created a script that would automatically connect to the wifi and spoof of WiFi and sign up for a trial with unique credentials.

So far the program takes about 30 seconds to run.
