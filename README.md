## About:
Xfinity has over 18 million hotspots worldwide. If you don't already know you can get a free hour of high speed internet if you are in range by signing up to be a new customer. However the only thing that Xfinity will validate for when signing up new users is a unused email and new Mac Address.

So far the program takes about 30 seconds to run.

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
